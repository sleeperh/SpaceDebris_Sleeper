# SpaceDebris_Sleeper
 
Completed a quick Unity game tutorial called Space Debris. Downloaded assets and starter folder from https://www.raywenderlich.com/9175-introduction-to-unity-getting-started-part-2-2 I used that link to download the assets and starter folder for the tutorial and from that point I just followed the tutorial to create game objects and add various scripts and qualities, mainly rigidbody onto those game objects. I also learned about basic asset folder structure and organization. I also learned how to make prefabs from game objects. I used premade scripts to spawn asteroid prefabs into the game as well as a projectile shot from the player's spaceship. As you can see I do not play this game well. It was a fun little tutorial, though and served to get my feet wet in the waters of game programming.
